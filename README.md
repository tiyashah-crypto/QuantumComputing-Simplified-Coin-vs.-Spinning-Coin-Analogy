### 🧠 Concept Breakdown

| Topic                     | Classical Computing                      | Quantum Computing                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic Logic**           | A coin is either heads (1) or tails (0). | A spinning coin is in both states at once—**superposition**.            |
| **Speed**                 | Solves problems one step at a time.      | Can solve **multiple possibilities simultaneously**.                    |
| **Security** 🔐           | Tries passwords **one by one**.          | Can try **millions at once** using quantum parallelism.                 |
| **Medicine Discovery** 💊 | Simulates molecules slowly.              | Can simulate **many molecules at the same time**, speeding up research. |
